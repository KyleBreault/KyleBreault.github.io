          I am a dedicated ecologist with a passion for the natural world and a strong background in wildlife conservation and marine biology.
            I graduated from Edinboro University in May 2021, and had lots of amazing opportunities, 
              such as doing ecotourism in the Florida Keys, learning about ecology at the Pymatuning lab of ecology, 
              and a summer Research Experience for Undergraduates at Harvard University. 
          <br><br>After graduating from Edinboro, my journey has taken me from the depths of the ocean, 
              rolling mountains of the west, to the vibrant terrains of tropical islands, contributing to significant research and conservation efforts. 
            I have had the wonder of meeting many fantastic people who have taught me much about the world, culture, and science. 
          <br><br>I am excited to be continuing my scientific journey through graduate school at the University of Alabama, 
              and I look forward to what I will get to learn next!
