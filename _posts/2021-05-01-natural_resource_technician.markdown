description: My first job out of college was working as a Natural Resource Technician in Cimarron, New Mexico. I gained various exciting and helpful skills, such as habitat restoration, herbicide treatment, and end-of-season field report writing. As a budding wildlife biologist, one of the most unique parts of my job was nuisance bear control, where I was a first responder to bear incidents on the ranch.<br><br>I worked directly under wildlife biologist Casey Myers, who taught me my first significant lesson related to wildlife management - "Wildlife management is land management." To this extent, this job presented numerous challenges that required me to collaborate with fellow scientists to solve complex tasks as a team. Many of these tasks included various land management activities to preserve wildlife. My experiences in New Mexico broadened my understanding of land management, wildlife conservation, and ecological research.
