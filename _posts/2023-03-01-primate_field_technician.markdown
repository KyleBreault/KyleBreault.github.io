description: While sturgeon is fascinating, it was also a welcome change to "get my feet dry" and return to terrestrial work. I had the opportunity to travel to Puerto Rico to study rhesus monkeys at Cayo Santiago, the Caribbean Primate Research Center. During this project, I was affiliated with the James Highman lab at New York University, collecting noninvasive data such as urine, fecal, and wound analysis for use in aging studies. In Puerto Rico, my role offered a new and exciting challenge - learning to identify individual monkeys. On Cayo Santiago, there are approximately 1,500 monkeys, and my task involved identifying and tracking a specific group of 50. I needed to know each of my individual monkeys, and learning them in a sea of so many monkeys was difficult. Identifying monkeys required meticulous attention to detail, recording every aspect of each monkey, including their unique behaviors (one monkey I could initially only remember by the way he licked his wrist every 10 seconds), intriguing social patterns (like that one mating pair that got mad when I was around), and discerning their physical features (you would be surprised that a "crooked tail" is a pervasive, often unhelpful feature). This experience undoubtedly taught me patience and honed my skills in maintaining organized and detailed field notes.
