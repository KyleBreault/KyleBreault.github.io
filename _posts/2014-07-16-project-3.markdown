description: After working in pest control, I was eager to return to the scientific realm, which led me to my most challenging and rewarding job to date as a fisheries observer in Hawaii. Here, I worked on a fishing vessel out at sea for a month. I collected species identification data, size, sex, and recorded protected species interactions with working hours extending beyond 100 hours per week. The vessels I worked on were small, often only 50 to 70 feet long, lacking amenities like a bathroom or air conditioning, and frequently dealing with bed bugs and cockroach infestations. The crew came from Asian countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia, providing a phenomenal cultural exchange. However, this meant I was often the only English speaker on the boat, which made communicating with the crew about sustainable fishing practices a challenging yet exciting task. In this unique setting, I not only collected crucial biological data but also played a vital role in instructing the crew on proper fishing practices. This educational aspect of my work was instrumental in ensuring sustainable fishing practices and preserving marine ecosystems. This experience further expanded my scientific knowledge and enhanced my appreciation for the intricate workings of marine ecosystems.
