description: At the end of my observer contract, I traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to work with Atlantic Sturgeon under Dr. Jason Kahn, the National Training Coordinator for Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, and Dr. Christian Hager, CEO of Chesapeake Scientific. We embarked on a challenging fieldwork expedition, often enduring 14-hour days, wrestling with massive, powerful fish that had the potential to inflict severe harm with one powerful tail strike. While I thankfully escaped with nothing more than a mild concussion, this experience deepened my appreciation for the dedication required in scientific research.<br><br>During our work, we collected crucial ecological data, including DNA samples, length, weight, sex, egg, and sperm samples, and fitted the sturgeon with tracking devices. My involvement continued in the field; I continued to collaborate with Dr. Kahn and Dr. Chris Hager in a remote capacity, helping with data analysis and paper writing. Working alongside Dr. Kahn, I contributed to a peer-reviewed scientific paper. With Dr. Hager, we produced two government technical reports commissioned by the Department of the Interior to assess the potential impacts of wind farm development on marine life. This experience introduced me to the world of technical writing as a government contractor. It also highlighted the importance of scientist's advocation, even when their findings contradict established practices.
