<h5><i>Arrival and departure windows of Atlantic sturgeon in the Chesapeake Bay, United States</i></h5>

Atlantic sturgeon that are a part of the Chesapeake Bay distinct population segment occupy the Chesapeake Bay before their spawning runs upriver. Determining when Atlantic sturgeon are in the Chesapeake Bay is important for managers to make informed decisions, because collisions with ships and fishing bycatch are of particular concern. Knowing exactly when Atlantic sturgeon are in the bay is vital for their conservation. This paper was accepted in the Fishery Bulletin [in press].<br><br>

<h5><i>Spatiotemporal Distributions of Species Detected within Virginia’s Offshore Lease Areas,  Volume 1 Sandbridge Shoal Borrow and Volume 2 The Virginia Wind Energy Lease Area A-0483</i></h5>

This project was contracted by the Department of the Interior to assess how the development of offshore windfarms may potentially impact different marine species. Using acoustic telemetry data, we assessed occupancy times of species of commercial, recreational, or conservation importance within the potential windfarm development area.
