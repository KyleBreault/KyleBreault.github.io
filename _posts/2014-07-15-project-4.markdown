description: Taking on this role presented a unique challenge for me as I am deathly afraid of heights, so this job pushed me out of my comfort zone. Often, animals would break into homes through roofs, and to exclude or remove animals often involved significant ladder work. Despite it not being a "scientific" role in the traditional sense, it was fundamental in cultivating my knowledge of wildlife.<br><br>In this position, I learned the intricacies of nuisance wildlife management, how to determine entry points into a home, how to exclude animal entry, and, when necessary, correctly trap and euthanize wildlife. I also did general pest control and got acquainted with pesticide and insect behavior. The most rewarding aspect of this position was the problem-solving it demanded. I had to visit homes and apply my understanding of animal biology to determine how and why animals might be gaining entry and how to exclude or remove them. Here, I got to use my wildlife knowledge in a business setting, which expanded my expertise.
